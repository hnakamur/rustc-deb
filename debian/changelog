rustc (1.0.0+dfsg1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Angus Lees ]
  * Set SONAME when building dylibs
  * Split out libstd-rust, libstd-rust-dev, rust-gdb, rust-lldb from rustc
    - libs are now installed into multiarch-friendly locations
    - rpath is no longer required to use dylibs (but talk to Debian Rust
      maintainers before building a package that depends on the dylibs)
  * Install /usr/share/rustc/architecture.mk, which declares Rust arch
    triples for Debian archs and is intended to help future Rust packaging
    efforts.  Warning: it may not be complete/accurate yet.
