rustc (1.1.0+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Angus Lees ]
  * Replace remote Rust logo with local file in HTML docs.
  * Symlink rust-{gdb,lldb}.1 to {gdb,lldb}.1 manpages.
    Note that gdb.1 requires the gdb-doc package, and that lldb.1 doesn't
    exist yet (see #792908).
  * Restore "Architecture: amd64 i386" filter, mistakenly removed in
    previous version.  Unfortunately the toolchain bootstrap isn't ready
    to support all Debian archs yet.  Closes: #793147.

  [ Angus Lees ]
  * Set SONAME when building dylibs
  * Split out libstd-rust, libstd-rust-dev, rust-gdb, rust-lldb from rustc
    - libs are now installed into multiarch-friendly locations
    - rpath is no longer required to use dylibs (but talk to Debian Rust
      maintainers before building a package that depends on the dylibs)
  * Install /usr/share/rustc/architecture.mk, which declares Rust arch
    triples for Debian archs and is intended to help future Rust packaging
    efforts.  Warning: it may not be complete/accurate yet.
  * New upstream release (1.1)
