Description: Rust systems programming language
 Rust is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language.  It
 visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly
 in syntactic and semantic details.  Its design is oriented toward
 concerns of "programming in the large", that is, of creating and
 maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational - that
 preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.
 .
 It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor,
 object-oriented and pure functional styles.  Rust also supports
 generic programming and meta-programming, in both static and dynamic
 styles.
