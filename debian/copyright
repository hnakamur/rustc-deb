 Software Grant License Agreement ("Agreement")
 .
 Except for the license granted herein to you, ARM Limited ("ARM") reserves all
 right, title, and interest in and to the Software (defined below).
 .
 Definition
 .
 "Software" means the code and documentation as well as any original work of
 authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
 is intentionally submitted by ARM to llvm.org (http://llvm.org) ("LLVM") for
 inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by LLVM
 (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
 electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to LLVM or its
 representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
 mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
 managed by, or on behalf of, LLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
 the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked otherwise.
 .
 1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, ARM hereby grants to you and to recipients of the Software
    distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
    works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Software and such derivative works.
 .
 2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement, ARM hereby grants you and to recipients of the Software
    distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
    to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by ARM that are necessarily infringed by ARM's Software alone or by
    combination of the Software with the Work to which such Software was
    submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against ARM or any
    other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
    that ARM's Software, or the Work to which ARM has contributed constitutes
    direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
    to that entity under this Agreement for the Software or Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
 conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
 The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works.  The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license.  The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
 any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
 Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
 other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

 .
 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	 wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
      for the public:

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
	1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
	   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
	   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
	   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
	     a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
		in part; and
 .
	     b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
	2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
	   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
	   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
	   its terms and conditions.
 .
	3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
	   6(a).
 .
	4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
	   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
	   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
	   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
	   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
	   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
	   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
	   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
	   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
	   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
	   (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
	5. Downstream recipients.
 .
	     a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
		recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
		receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
		Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
		Public License.
 .
	     b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
		any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
		apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
		Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
		Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
		Material.
 .
	6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
	   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
	   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
	   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
	   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
	   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
	1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
	   licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
	   privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
	   the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
	   assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
	   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
	   Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
	2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
	   Public License.
 .
	3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
	   collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
	   Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
	   under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
	   licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
	   reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.

		with the Licensed Material:
 .
		  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
		     Material and any others designated to receive
		     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
		     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
		     designated);
 .
		 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
		iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

 .
	     c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
		Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
		hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
	2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
	   reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
	   which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
	   reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
	   hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
	   information.
 .
	3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
	   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
	   reasonably practicable.
 .
	4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
	   License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
	   Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
	1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
	   it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
	   violation; or
 .
	2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .

      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
